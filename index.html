	<p>I am fairly comfortable with html, but haven't extensively used style sheet and javascript.  
	I want to explore some options for improving my	local office website which I maintain. 
	On a personal level I want to improve my church's website and also help some of my 
	FIRST Tech Challenge students learn how maintain their teams website. </p>  
	
	<p> I'd say I'm a intermediate with html.  I'm an advance-beginner with CSS and definitely
	a beginner in javascript.</p>
