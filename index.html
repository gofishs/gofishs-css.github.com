	<p style="font-family: Lucida Calligraphy; color:blue"><strong>  So what do I hope to get out
	of this class? </strong></p> 
	
	
	<p>I am fairly comfortable with html, 
	but haven't extensively used style sheets and javascript.  
	I want to explore some options for improving my	local office website which I maintain. 
	On a personal level I want to improve my church's website and also help some of my 
	FIRST Tech Challenge students learn how maintain their teams website. </tr>  
	</p>
	<p style="font-family: Lucida Calligraphy; color:blue"> <strong> Self-Assessment: </strong></p>
	
	<p>I'd say I'm an intermediate with html.  
	I'm an advance-beginner with CSS and definitely
	a beginner in javascript.</p>
